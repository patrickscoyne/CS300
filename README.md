What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

  The projects in this course involved developing a program for academic advisors in a hypothetical situation. The program needed to be able to load a list of courses from a CSV file and store them in a data structure I saw fit. After loading the courses, the program needed to check the list and make sure any course prerequisites existed in the course list, and if not, the course would be deleted. Additionally, the program had to allow the user to search for a course by its ID and print the course details, such as the course name and prerequisites. Lastly, the program needed to sort all courses alphanumerically and print them.
 
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand. 

  First, I needed to know how each data structure functioned and compare the various program requirements' run times. This course taught me how to analyze the time complexity of algorithms and use Big-O notation. After comparing the time complexity of using a vector, hash table, and binary search tree, I used a hash table for the project.
 
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered during the activities or project? I experienced some roadblocks when it came to coding throughout this course. 
	
  Mainly, coding binary search trees was challenging. Binary search trees were entirely new to me, and I needed to refer to the course resources several times to comprehend the use of pointers when inserting and searching a tree entirely. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs? 
	
  Learning about algorithms and their time complexity has taught me to analyze run times before deciding on a particular data structure and algorithm. Developing efficient code is critical in the software industry. The skills I learned throughout this course have allowed me to evaluate different options that will meet a program's requirements and use the best one. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
	
  This course consisted of several coding assignments and two project milestones. Knowing I could reuse portions of logic, code, and pseudocode in the project, I aimed to make my assignments adaptable. Working in code from previous assignments took minimal effort when it came time for the final projects. This course showed me how creating adaptable code can save time and effort, which is highly beneficial in the software industry.
